                    <p>I have an extensive background in teaching large, foundational communication courses, such as <b>Communication Theory</b> and <b>Communication Research Methods</b>. I have also taught specialized electives, such as <b>Survey of Health Communication</b> and <b>Issues in Health Communication</b>, which draw from my research and attract students from psychology, nutritional sciences, community health, nursing, and pre-med.</p>

                    <p>In addition, I have experience and passion about contributing to curricular innovation. For example, I developed <b>Health Communication Campaigns</b>, an upper-level undergraduate course where students learn to evaluate persuasive strategies and create their own theory-informed health messages tailored to college campuses or community settings.</p>

                    <p>At the graduate level, I have remained actively involved in teaching and mentorship. I have taught graduate-level courses <b>Health Communication</b> and <b>Communication as Ethical Practice</b>. I have been working closely with graduate students through individualized mentoring, committee work, and collaborative research.</p>

                    <p>In Spring 2025, I mentored three Ph.D. students through <b>Communication Research Task Groups</b>. I met weekly with two of them to support their independent research and provide feedback on evolving drafts. One student’s research from this project was accepted for presentation at the annual convention of the National Communication Association (NCA) this November. For the third student, I designed a structured, reading-intensive plan to build expertise at the intersection of communication and public health, aimed at preparing them for the general exam and informing their dissertation research.</p>
                    
                    <p>At OU, my graduate advising roles include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Serving as the advisor for one Ph.D. student (currently completing coursework)
                            </li>
                            <li>Serving on the committees of two Ph.D. students (one passed the general exam in Spring 2025; the other plans to take the general exam in Fall 2025)
                            </li>
                            <li>Serving on the committee of one M.A. student (defended thesis in Spring 2025)</li>
                            <li>Serving as the first-year mentor for two Ph.D. students</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
