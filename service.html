                    <p>I view service as an essential part of my academic identity. I am committed to contributing to the department, university, and discipline through sustained and meaningful engagement.</p>

                    <p>From 2022-2024, I served on the department’s <b>Graduate Committee</b>, where I reviewed Ph.D. and M.A. applications, participated in funding and admissions discussions, and met with prospective students to address their questions about the program. In 2022, I served on the <b>Graduate Program Climate Task Force</b>. Along with my colleagues, we reviewed questionnaire responses and identified strengths and areas for improvement within the program. In 2023-2024, I contributed to faculty hiring as a member of the <b>Faculty Search Committee</b>. In this role, I reviewed application materials, conducted a series of interviews with other committee members, and participated in deliberations about hiring decisions.</p>

                    <p>At the disciplinary level, I regularly review conference submissions for both the National Communication Association (NCA) and the International Communication Association (ICA) annual conferences. Over the years, I have consistently reviewed for journals that advance health communication theory and practice. In 2025, I am honored to join the <b>editorial boards</b> of <i>Health Communication</i> and <i>Journal of Health Communication</i>.</p>

                    <p>Looking ahead, I aim to continue and expand my service, particularly in roles that support graduate education, strengthen faculty development, and advance the visibility and impact of communication research.</p>
